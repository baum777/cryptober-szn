## Quality Metrics

**Branch:** `claude/session-011CUZFtvCvNrwbdd1TVZ3Pk`

| Metric | Result | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Tests | ✅ 56/56 | All passing (StatusGlyph, Cards, Sections, motion) |
| Lint | ✅ PASS | 0 errors in new foundation files |
| Typecheck | ✅ PASS | JSDoc validation clean |
| A11y | ✅ OK | ARIA regions, focus rings, semantic HTML |
| Motion | ✅ OK | Reduced-motion respected (JS + CSS) |
| Breakpoints | ✅ OK | ≥1024px, 768-1023px, ≤767px |
| Tokens | ✅ OK | All shared tokens used correctly |
| Scope | ✅ OK | No feature creep, contracts enforced |

---

## Integration Status

**Current State:** Opt-in (not active by default)

The new foundation components are available but **not enabled**. They run alongside the existing `questmap.js` implementation with zero breaking changes.

**To Enable:**
1. Uncomment imports in `/js/boot-home.js` (lines 43-93)
2. Add HTML containers: `#timeline-foundation`, `#questmap-foundation`
3. Call `initFoundationComponents()` function

**Migration Path:** Incremental adoption. Future PRs can gradually transition from old to new components.

## Architectural Contracts Status

| Contract | Status | Verified By |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Timeline/QuestMap separation | ✅ ENFORCED | reviewer |
| Status enum (`now\|next\|done\|later`) | ✅ ENFORCED | tester, reviewer |
| Breakpoints (3 specific ranges) | ✅ ENFORCED | tester, reviewer |
| Reduced-motion support | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | tester, reviewer |
| ARIA compliance | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | tester, reviewer |
| Token discipline | ✅ MAINTAINED | reviewer |
